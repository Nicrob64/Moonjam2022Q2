## Introduction
Welcome to your new job at Zeal, the world's foremost company for online shopping, shipping and distribution, digital services, logistics, and synergizing brand affinity through customer and employee loyalty. To make it in this job, you'll need a positive attitude, a tireless work ethic, and most importantly, an iron bladder.

### Tips
* Keep an eye on your Piss Meter in the top left of your screen. If it gets full and you don't relieve yourself quickly, something bad could happen!
* Going to the bathroom is very time consuming, so if you find a bottle to piss in you could use that instead. This is not endorsed by the company.
